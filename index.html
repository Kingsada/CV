                    <p><strong><em>Project Coordinator and Development Practitioner</em></strong></p>
                    <p>I am a committed and hard-working project coordinator and development practitioner with a demonstrated experience in managing community development, climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction projects in Laos and Tonga. I also have in-depth knowledge and a clear understanding of project management and implementation, public and private sector coordination, and monitoring and evaluation with a Master’s Degree focused on Disaster Management and International Development from Auckland University. As an MFAT and UGRADE Scholar, I aspire to continue widening my horizon by learning from colleagues from around the world and bringing diversity to the global community with efforts to improve the lives of the poor and most vulnerable. I believe if we work together and listen to one another, we will eradicate poverty and social injustice.</p></td>
